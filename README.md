# Smart Contract Compliance Checker (AI + RAG)

A production-ready, AI-powered tool that uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to analyze Solidity smart contracts for compliance, security, and upgradeability.

>  Built with LangChain + ChromaDB + Hugging Face
>  Powered by OpenZeppelin & Ethereum EIPs
>  Deployed with Streamlit Cloud
>  Not just an LLM wrapper â€” itâ€™s a real RAG system for blockchain security.

## About This Project:

 Ultilization of **LLM integration with semantic search**
 Proper **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application
 Domain-specific knowledge in **blockchain and smart contract security**
 Real-world utility, not just another chatbot

##  What It Does

Paste any Solidity smart contract and get:

| Feature                    | Output                                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Compliance Score**     | Visual gauge from 0â€“100 based on rule-based checks                   |
|  **Risk Breakdown**      | List of missing security patterns with severity labels (High/Medium) |
|  **AI Suggestions**      | Smart fix recommendations using RAG pipeline                         |
|  **References Included** | Each suggestion is grounded in OpenZeppelin Docs or EIPs             |

## Reason Why I Built This Project

Smart contracts run **billions of dollars**, but:

* Many are **not audited**.
* Security patterns like `Ownable`, `nonReentrant`, or `UUPSUpgradeable` are **often missing**.
* AI tools usually hallucinate â€” but **this app grounds every suggestion in trusted docs**.

> This is a real-world **Solidity compliance assistant** â€” not a toy LLM demo.

##  Tech Stack

| Component        | Tool / Library                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| UI               | `Streamlit`                               |
| RAG Framework    | `LangChain`                               |
| Embedding Model  | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`  |
| Vector Database  | `Chroma` (local persistent)               |
| LLM Inference    | `Falcon-7B-Instruct` via Hugging Face Hub |
| Compliance Logic | Rule-based Python scoring system          |

## How RAG Works Here

 **Retrieval**:
OpenZeppelin + EIPs are embedded using `MiniLM` and stored in Chroma.

 **Augmentation**:
On input, the top-k relevant doc chunks are retrieved via semantic search.

 **Generation**:
The prompt + retrieved chunks are passed to `Falcon-7B-Instruct` via Hugging Face Hub.

 **Grounded Output**:
The suggestion + source snippet is shown in UI â€” not hallucinated.
